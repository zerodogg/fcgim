fcgim - [F]ast[CGI] application [m]anager

fcgim is a FastCGI application manager. It handles starting/stopping/restarting
many different FastCGI instances and provides a simple initscript-like interface
to performing actions on them.

Currently it only supports Catalyst FastCGI applications, but adding support for
new types of applications is simple, and can be done in roughly 100 lines of
code (including comments). See ./lib/FCGIM/Methods/Catalyst.pm for an example.
