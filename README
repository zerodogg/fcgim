fcgim - [F]ast[CGI] application [m]anager

fcgim is a FastCGI application manager. It handles starting/stopping/restarting
many different FastCGI instances and provides a simple initscript-like interface
to performing actions on them.

Currently it only supports Catalyst and PHP FastCGI applications, but adding
support for new types of applications is simple, and can be done in under 100
lines of code (including comments). See ./lib/FCGIM/Methods/Catalyst.pm for an
example.
